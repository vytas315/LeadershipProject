	   		<h2 class="tile-title">Ari Studnitzer</h2>
	   		<dl>
	   			<dd>Mr. Studnitzer, a Booth MBA graduate and Managing Director at CME Group, currently leads a small team of 3 direct reports, and indirectly leads a large-scale change effort enlisting the help of hundreds of people spanning multiple departments - without formal authority.  He combines the change management methods described in “Tipping Point Leadership” (the HBR article) and “Give and Take” (a book by Adam Grant) with disruptive innovation (ala Clayton Christensen) to create his own unique brand of leadership steeped in Booth MBA teachings.</dd>
	   			<dt>Why we selected Ari</dt>
	   			<dd>We chose Ari as one of our interviewees to provide the perspective of someone currently embroiled in a battle for leading change in a successful competitive company that, with 55% margins, does not necessarily see the need to change.  In this situation, Ari represents someone who has to fight for change to take hold, along the way overcoming politically driven gatekeepers.</dd>

	   		<h2 class="tile-title">Laura Truax</h2>
	   		<dl>
	   			<dd>Rev. Laura Sumner Truax is the senior pastor at LaSalle Street Church, a non-denominational church in downtown Chicago with a long tradition of uniting individual faith in Christ with God's call for justice and compassion lived out in the world.
	   			<br><br> 
				Laura is the author of Undone:When coming apart puts you back together, published by InterVarsity Press August 2013. 
				<br><br>
				Rev. Truax holds a Master’s in Pastoral Studies with an emphasis in Spirituality and a Master’s of Divinity degree and serves as a teaching pastor for the University of Chicago and for World Vision International.</dd>
	   			<dt>Why we selected Laura</dt>
	   			<dd>We selected Laura because our theme was leading without formal authority. As the pastor of a church, Laura’s role is leading a congregation of people who are not compelled to come. There are many churches, so the success of a non-denominational church like LaSalle is directly tied to the quality of leadership and the pastor’s ability to foster active leaders and followers within the congregation.</dd>

	   		<h2 class="tile-title">Tom Behringer</h2>
	   		<dl>

Tom has a bachelors degree in civil engineering from the University of Cincinnati and masters in civil engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago.</dd>
	   			<dt>Why we selected Tom</dt>
	   			<dd>Tom was selected because he offered a unique perspective as a consultant to a very rigid, hierarchical industry: power generation.  We felt that his insights into how best to lead a company that is at the mercy of the fast moving and demanding power generation industry would give us invaluable insight into some best practices for leadership.  In addition to this, Tom is very well respected within his firm and it was felt he would be capable and willing to give honest but useful material on how to lead a unique organization.</dd>

	   			<dt>Why we selected Mike</dt>
	   			<dd>Software produced by Systems is not only used by other departments, but is also dependent on those departments for implementation as well as content and design guidance.

	   			<dt>Why we selected Deb</dt>
