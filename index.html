	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>Teams work on a relationship basis in this environment. Deb effectively leads teams by the mantra, “Build those relationships!” One important aspect that increased team coherence was when an executive told a member (client) that the client’s organization was no longer welcome because the client disrespected a staff team-member. Integrity of this caliber is not often found, but it was very effective in fostering trust within the team.</dd>
	   			<dt>How we can put it into practice</dt>
	   			<dd>Relationships foster trust and cohesion within a team. In an environment without formal authority, it is due to relationships that teams will follow a leader. Leaders must take time to build these relationships by getting to know individuals throughout the organization. In Deb's example, they must also stand up for their members, even if that costs clients.</dd>

These sessions initiate new members into the existing ethos of the community while allowing new values to emerge over time.

	   			<dd>For Ari, “Painting the house on the hill” takes communication skills, and you have to have the ability to adapt your vision for the receiver.  In a profitable company, risk aversion is very powerful - “For me the hardest part is getting that buy in when things aren’t that bad, not great, but not that bad… the fear of doing something is stronger than the upside of doing something.  [Without formal authority], you need to show people why doing something is better.  You need to be able to incentivize them to their own incentive.  ‘Why?  Because your career will be better if you are part of the house on the hill’ ”.</dd>

	   		<dl>
	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>Mike described how McMaster uses documents and summits to communicate vision. When Systems takes on a new topic, they publish a charter describing the work and the benefit they wish to achieve. The publication of the document not only informs, but also provides an opportunity for feedback. It then becomes a contract between the company and Systems. The transparency of this action and forewarning helps create buy in across the company.
				<br><br>
				When working with another department, Mike has found it useful to use their language. Talk in terms of both words and goals that they understand. Don’t try to teach them your world, understand theirs. Taking it back to customer benefit is often a common language everyone understands. Painting a picture of what the outcome would look like is often helpful.</dd>

	   		<dl>
	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>When working on a specific thread, more precise tactics are sometimes required when the group runs into a roadblock. Higher level leadership cannot always be depended upon to settle disagreements. Tension between departments is sometimes used as checks and balances. Mike described one project in which directors from Systems each had one on one meetings with their counterparts in another department in order to include them in an “extraordinary way”. In this way, he was able to gauge their thoughts and adjust the content for their next large group meeting.
				<br><br>
				Another way in which to move past a roadblock is to invite new participants into the discussion. They can introduce new energy and just might see the situation in a different way.
				<br><br>
				Another tactic was to break up dissenters. Make sure that a minority cannot hijack meetings and continually steer the discussion away from the vision. Without critical mass, a single dissenter is much more easily managed.</dd>
	   			<dt>How we can put it into practice</dt>

	   		<dl>
	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>Mike said that the “Company can create alignment for a common mission.” McMaster does this through what they call design groups. Individuals from around the company gather to discuss an idea that the company has been grappling with. Departments contribute some of their top performers for these assignments. Throughout the process, they also check in regularly and provide helpful resources and guidance. Because of the broad participation and because they “ponied up the best individuals”, the outcomes of these design groups are highly regarded throughout the company. In this way, many debated topics are put to rest and a common vision is developed. Management within Systems can then take the vision and bring it to fruition over months and years.
				<br><br>
				In another example, Mike described how a summit was held with 50 of the top executives from around the company. In it, they listened and gathered ideas for the next several year’s worth of work. These ideas were later compiled into a common vision for the department and company as a whole. Because it was born out of a discussion with the entire company, there was great alignment and motivation around a common vision.</dd>
	   			<dt>How we can put it into practice</dt>
	   			<dd>Don't build vision on your own. The easiest way to have a shared vision is to create it together. Involve the company in the creation and evolution of the vision.</dd>

	   			<dd>McMaster develops folks with a variety of backgrounds. The idea is that broad skillsets allow individuals to move around the organization and to gain an appreciation for the variety of work we do. Therefore, when it comes time to work across departments, peers are more likely to find common ground and work with the interest of the company in mind. This is often difficult, especially within Systems where individuals often remain in the same department for longer tenures than other areas in the company.</dd>
	   			<dt>How we can put it into practice</dt>
	   			<dd>Individuals with broad experiences are more likely to buy into a company wide vision even if it makes for more work in their department. Hiring practices and project assignments can make a culture that is more likely view vision open mindedly.</dd>

	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>Tom described the importance of first having strong listening skills.  “You need to be able to listen, and really listen – this leads to the ability to communicate.  In my field we have lot of really really bright people, but they are not always the most articulate.  If you can get them to communicate those points (that is the key to solving a problem).”  Tom also described the need to mediate different people on both sides of the problem as an essential responsibility of a leader – sometimes things have been missed and no one realizes it because there hasn’t been effective communication.  It is the leader’s job to facilitate this communication.</dd>

	   			<dd>Listen before trying to communicate your vision. If you don't listen, you won't learn about the actual problem you're trying to solve.</dd>

	   		<dl>
	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>According to Tom, the first step in properly aligning people is understanding your employees – “Do your homework on people.”  Related to this, proper alignment requires people to be inspired to follow you.  He stated, “The people I have looked up to as mentors were not only very good technically, but were approachable and were willing to listen to what you were trying to do… They were gentlemen about it.”  Tom also described the need create an atmosphere where properly aligned people can function effectively.  At Sargent & Lundy the organization had to be changed – he explained, “When you are trying to be closer to your client, you need people to be able to directly connect to your client.”  For this reason the company transitioned to becoming a flatter, customer-centric organization.  The work groups, instead of being ‘mechanical’, ‘structural’, and ‘electrical’, were now ‘Exelon’, ‘South Texas Power’, etc.  In this structure the client’s needs were put first and different types of engineers were put in each group.  Finally, Tom explained that “There are limits to informal leadership.” – Meaning you can only go so far informally through inspiration.  Sometimes you need formal authority to actually get work done.</dd>

	   		<dl>
	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>According to Tom, leadership and followership go hand in hand – sometimes you are a leader, then minutes later you could be a follower.  “You are not always in one of those roles – you may in the course of a day, week, or period in time be in multiple of those roles.  There are times when you need to take leadership within a group, and there are times you are not the right person to do that, and you have to be supportive.”</dd>
	   			<dt>How we can put it into practice</dt>
	   			<dd>Be aware of when you should be wearing your leadership hat vs. followership hat. And recognize that this change can happen frequently in the day as you move between different groups or situations.</dd>
