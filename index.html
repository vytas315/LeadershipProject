	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>Most communication is relayed through outcomes and highlighting actions. The previous executive spent members' money on trips to Russia, thereby deviating from the organization's mission. Ms. Clapp immediately ceased those activities and ran the organizations at a surplus , thereby sending a message to her members saying the organization was returning to its original mission.</dd>

	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>In managing over 200 member theatres, coalitions can make or break initiatives because each member elects to join the League. Before an initiative is proposed, it is crucial that Deb builds a coalition around the initiative. When asked if she ever presented an initiative that was vetoed, she said, “I can’t take those kinds of chances and have it turn into a [public] fight...I wouldn’t put it out there if there was any chance that it would get voted down; I cant!”</dd>

	   		<dl>
	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>A sole visionary identified that value can be added to a specific community of organizations (theatres) operating in the same geographic area and industry. These organizations are not formally organized to increase their scope and influence. Therefore, this visionary created an organization that serves, caters to, and predicts the members’ needs so as to increase their power and influence.</dd>
	   			<dt>What we learned</dt>

	   		<dl>
	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>Teams work on a relationship basis in this environment. Deb effectively leads teams by the mantra, “Build those relationships!” One important aspect that increased team coherence was when an executive told a member (client) that the client’s organization was no longer welcome because the client disrespected a staff team-member. Integrity of this caliber is not often found, but it was very effective in fostering trust within the team.</dd>
	   			<dt>What we learned</dt>
	   			<dd>Relationships foster trust and cohesion within a team. In an environment without formal authority, it is due to relationships that teams will follow a leader. Leaders must take time to build these relationships by getting to know individuals throughout the organization. In Deb's example, they must also stand up for their members, even if that costs clients.</dd>

	   			<dt>What we learned</dt>
	   			<dd>Don't hide from conflict. If disagreement exists, air it out in an appropriate environment. It might be grabbing coffee or scheduling a meeting. Just make sure you have a gameplan and your ego isn't getting in the way.</dd>

I am totally in their corner. I am pulling for them, I’m thinking about them, I’m seeking their welfare in the very best sense of the word. And I think of other non-profits I’ve been associated with and the very best leaders all share that quality. And, they’re able to communicate that.”</dd>

	   			<dd>Laura ‘Vision-Casts’ with the congregation at the annual off-site retreat. She brainstorms with the congregation about shared values, ideas for change, and new ministry opportunities. She distills many ideas into themes and then asks questions about how those themes are connected. She uses the congregation’s words and values and shapes them into areas for further consideration. These sessions initiate new members into the existing ethos of the community while allowing new values to emerge over time. This method creates substantial buy-in because the congregation took an active roll in determining the annual points of emphasis.</dd>
	   			<dt>What we learned</dt>

	   		<dl>
	   			<dt>What we heard</dt>
	   			<dd>Laura leads change by seeing issues that need to be addressed (presence in the community), calling attention to them (preaching and informal discussions), forming an initial task force to discuss the issue (announcing a meeting open to the whole community), and then getting out of the way to see if it turns into anything. She believes the ideas that gain traction are the initiatives that directly connect the values of the congregation with action. She drops initiatives that don’t have a congregational champion, saying: “[A leader’s] ego must continually die.”</dd>
	   			<dt>What we learned</dt>
