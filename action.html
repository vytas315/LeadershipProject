	   		<dl>
	   			<dt>Source of Vision</dt>
	   			<dd>The methods for vision-casting differ across profit and nonprofit organizations. If you, as the leader, have a crucible life experience that has given rise to a vision, use the crucible as inspiration and communicate to your followers the impact the crucible has had on you. The challenge is not in identifying the passion, but rather the process of refining the vision so that it is focused enough to persuade others to contribute. Understanding the metamorphosis of the crucible is so important because it helps pinpoint the vision’s source to your audience. <br><br>
				A leader must champion the idea and engage intended supporters, beneficiaries, and other community leaders so as to garner a second champion (much like Mandela did with Pienaar). This is also important because it allows for a supportable, long-term vision. <br><br>
				Communication Tactics –To act on insight from our interviewees, Deb and Laura, you should communicate when you can make your message resonate with your followers’ values. Regardless of the form of communication, a leader with informal authority must draw connections between the vision, the values, and your actions. This may be through open forums or presentations, but can also be through your quarterly financials if you show you can show you made sacrifices for the benefit of your followers. Finally, ensure every stakeholder can succinctly communicate the vision and tie it back to the task at hand. </dd>
				<dt>Aligning / Inspiring</dt>
				<dd>Authentic self-expression is vital to create alignment and inspiration. All our interviewees stressed a “Ministry of Presence” – where the leader must care for those he seeks to influence. Similar to the EIS simulation, take indirect actions to stay on the followers’ path to accomplish a goal. Invest your time to build relationships with followers as it builds your ‘Leadership Capital,’ which can be drawn upon when you need them to act on the bond of trust you have built. <br><br>
				If you find you do not have sufficient informal leadership capital to carry a new initiative, identify and build key coalitions with influencers (like Deb does); then carry out the initiative with your new influencers’ support.</dd>
				<dt>Teams and Individuals</dt>
				<dd>Non-profit leaders face more challenges in the areas of managing teams and individuals than their for-profit counterparts. Be aware that your volunteers often have higher-priority competing interests. Therefore, you must set an example by being accountable while being flexible and gracious with those who do not meet deadlines. Respect that this is a common drawback to leading informally and work hard to minimize it by collectively setting high organizational expectations, developing roles for volunteers of all levels of commitment, and assigning tasks based on the appropriate engagement level of the individual. <br><br>
 				“Build those relationships” by dedicating at least a third of your time to meet with board members, influencers, and funders. Increase your influence and credibility by allowing others to take up the leadership mantle when their skills and energy are more appropriate. </dd>

	   		<h2 class="tile-title">Corporate Environment</h2>
	   		<dl>
	   			<dt>Source of Vision</dt>
	   			<dd>While a profitable company finds it challenging to pinpoint its vision, our analysis compels us to emulate Mike Meyers’ Design Group approach to get key managers and visionaries away from their daily jobs to create new initiatives and provide the compass and the company’s direction. Doing this also makes it harder for personality clashes and formal authority to derail the vision. In many for-profit organizations the source of the vision may well be the customer and if it is, then recognize the customer’s vision and tailor your vision to be in alignment with the customer.</dd>
				<dt>Communication Tactics</dt>
				<dd>Effectively communicating vision in a profit-orientated company requires that you focus on tailoring your message to your audience because it increases credibility. Use information you gain from your audience to ensure your message resonates with the recipient (“speak their language”).  In addition, focus on incentives or invite feedback wherever necessary. To illustrate, if you are talking to an accountant, talk about dollars that will be saved or earned; if you are talking to a manager, highlight increased worker productivity; if you are talking to a salesman, stress the benefits to the customer. 
				<dt>Aligning / Inspiring</dt>
				<dd>To align your followers in a for-profit, first ensure you respect the established hierarchy and its gatekeepers lest you are overrun by formal authority. Even if your vision does not inspire the gatekeepers, remember you are only seeking their alignment to get to your potential followers. Second, It is essential to properly understand the key elements of your vision, or “beachheads” as Ari called them. Sometimes, attacking your ultimate goal head-on can cause you to run into firm opposition, and it’s better to use a strategy of disruptive innovation. Choose a cause that people will feel guilty if they don’t support, yet is not threatening to the core value of the organization (a beachhead).  Get wins on the board and solidify key supporters, then move on to more controversial goals. <br><br>
				Next, it is essential to understand who the best people are for the job.  “Doing homework” on people is a key element to ensure proper alignment.  Look for people who are not only capable, but also the most excited about the vision. Keep in mind if people don’t believe you are genuinely there to help them and the organization, they will not support you. Finally, recognize the limits to informal leadership because sometimes people just won’t help you.  Recognizing when you are in this situation is very important – if all the aforementioned tactics to align and inspire (from the nonprofit action section fail) pivot your strategy and get support from those with formal authority, or exercise your own.
				<dt>Individuals and Teams</dt>
				<dd>Somewhat surprisingly, we found that the people we talked to shared the exact same philosophy concerning teams as what we discussed in class: leadership and followership go hand in hand. Moreover, all insights and actions that apply to nonprofits apply just as much to for-profits in this scenario. Leading in situations where you don’t have formal authority is often a dance between being a leader one minute and being a follower the next – a listening first strategy helps you to recognize when to be each; consequently, you will lead in areas you are stronger and build team coherence when you follow and let a teammate lead. Therefore, it is essential that you not dominate a situation – it relates back to the need to listen first - if you alienate your supporters, your will fall short of your goal. <br><br>
